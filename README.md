### Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on data analytics bachelors track on the education front but my payroll is attached to a banker role.
🌱 I’m currently learning ... on computer language programing. I've gotten my toes wet with MYSQL, TSQL and as of lately Python. Oh Boy... Python!

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can combine my banking background with tech. In other words, FINTECH.

🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices or resources to learn python language - I'm really stuck on it and is so interesting that I need to learn it.
💬 Ask me about ... retail and small business banking fundamentals, including credit and standard banking products if you are working on projects related to the field.
📫 Drop me an email at jm3eam@gmail.com - Spanflix.
⚡ Fun fact: I have 8 lefties in my family including me. 😝
